# Your Entire Dev Team, Automated

Stop context-switching between roles. Stop waiting for code reviews. Stop managing mundane tickets.

**Cielo Red is your complete AI development team** - from project management to deployment, all working autonomously in your GitHub workflows.

## Why Settle for One AI When You Can Have a Whole Team?

**Traditional approach:** One AI assistant doing everything poorly  
**Cielo Red approach:** Specialized AI agents for every role, working together seamlessly

### üèÜ Ship Faster, Sleep Better

- **No more bottlenecks**: Multiple specialists working in parallel, not serial
- **24/7 development**: Your team never stops working, even when you do
- **Zero onboarding**: New team members that know your codebase instantly
- **Consistent quality**: No off days, no rushed reviews, no human error

### üí∞ The Economics Are Obvious

- Replace expensive consultants with AI specialists
- Scale your team without hiring headaches
- Reduce time-to-market from months to days
- Free your humans for creative work, not tedious tasks

### üß† Intelligence That Actually Scales

Each role has its own expertise:
- **Manager**: Breaks down epics, creates tickets, manages priorities
- **Developer**: Writes code, implements features, fixes bugs
- **Architect**: Designs systems, enforces patterns, prevents technical debt
- **Security**: Finds vulnerabilities, enforces policies, secures deployments
- **QA**: Writes tests, validates features, catches edge cases
- **DevOps**: Manages infrastructure, optimizes CI/CD, monitors performance

## How It Actually Works

### 1. Intelligent Role Assignment
```yaml
# Your workflow becomes this simple
- uses: cielo-red/agent@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    # That's it. The system figures out who should work on what.
```

### 2. Self-Organizing Teams
- **New role needed?** AI generates expert prompts automatically
- **Custom expertise?** Override with your own `.cielo/agents/role.md` files
- **Multiple specialists?** They work in parallel, not conflict

### 3. Zero Configuration Required
```yaml
name: Complete SDLC Team

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  # Each role runs independently, in parallel
  manager: { uses: cielo-red/agent@v1 }
  developer: { uses: cielo-red/agent@v1 }
  security: { uses: cielo-red/agent@v1 }
  qa: { uses: cielo-red/agent@v1 }
  # Add any role you need - the system adapts
```

## Stop Doing Work Machines Should Do

### Before Cielo Red:
- üïê Wait for senior dev review ‚Üí **2-3 days**
- üïë Security review meeting ‚Üí **1 week**  
- üïí QA testing cycle ‚Üí **3-5 days**
- üïì Architecture approval ‚Üí **1-2 weeks**

### With Cielo Red:
- ‚ö° All reviews complete ‚Üí **Minutes**
- ‚ö° Security analysis ‚Üí **Automatic**
- ‚ö° Tests written & run ‚Üí **Immediate**
- ‚ö° Architecture validated ‚Üí **Real-time**

## The Proof Is In Production

**For Startups**: Get enterprise-level processes without enterprise headcount  
**For Scale-ups**: Maintain quality while moving fast  
**For Enterprises**: Reduce cycle time from quarters to sprints  

### Real Impact:
- **10x faster code reviews** (senior devs focus on architecture, not syntax)
- **Zero missed security issues** (every line gets expert security analysis)
- **100% test coverage** (QA agent writes comprehensive tests automatically)
- **Perfect documentation** (technical writer keeps everything updated)

## Get Started in 2 Minutes

### Option 1: The Full Team Experience
```bash
# Add this workflow and watch your productivity explode
curl -o .github/workflows/team.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cielo-red/agent/main/.github/workflows/team.yml
```

### Option 2: Start Small
```yaml
# Just add this to any workflow
- uses: cielo-red/agent@v1
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Authentication
```bash
# Get your API key: https://console.anthropic.com/
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --body "your-api-key"
```

## Why Every Smart Team Is Making This Switch

**Stop hiring for roles AI can fill perfectly**  
**Stop waiting for humans to do machine work**  
**Stop sacrificing quality for speed**

Your competition is already using AI teams. The question isn't whether to adopt this - it's whether you'll lead or follow.
